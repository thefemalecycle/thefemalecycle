- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thefemalecycle
I would like to list my business https://thefemalecycle.love on https://www.getmonero.org/community/merchants/#exchanges. 
As I'm not suuper tech-y I don't manage to open a GitHub issue and/or select "Merchant" template to fill up all sections.
Can anyone help?
Many thanks upfront!!
Angelika
